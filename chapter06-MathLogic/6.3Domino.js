/**
 * There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31
dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why
it's impossible). 
 * 
 Solution:
 If you have 64 slots - 32 black 32 white. 2 corners are black ones -
 30 black and 32 white and 31 dominos is bigger then 30.

 Other options are also with less then 31 dominos and free slots.
